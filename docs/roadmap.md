# TODO
- limit monitor/command result history (avoid memory leaks)
- cache for monitor's command results to minimize amount of commands actually run
- minimize scrolling areas in groupboxes so that the details view can be easily scrolled
- indicator when command is running
- Option for doing a partial auto-refresh after running a command
- Utilize system icons and themes? Can still offer and default to baked in style when necessary.
- modules as shared objects instead of compiled in?
- easily add self-made scripts as commands?
