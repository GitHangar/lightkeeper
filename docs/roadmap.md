# TODO
- limit monitor/command result history
- cache for monitor's command results to minimize amount of commands actually run
- minimize scrolling areas in groupboxes so that the details view can be easily scrolled
- indicator when command is running
- partial auto-refresh after commands?
- modules as shared objects instead of compiled in?
- easily add self-made scripts as commands?
