# TODO
More important features first.
- limit monitor/command result history (avoid memory leaks)
- cache for monitor's command results to minimize amount of commands actually run
- new module property `privileged` for modules that require sudo/root
- Check and display vuln status of system (or docker) packages using mitre, DSA and etc.
- Utilize system icons and themes? Can still offer and default to baked in style when necessary.
- modules as shared objects instead of compiled in?
- easily add self-made scripts (shell scripts etc.) as commands?
- Support SaaS-platforms? (probably outside of scope)

# Problems
- There doesn't seem to be a default hover-animation for RoundButton. Add a custom one?
