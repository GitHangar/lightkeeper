# TODO
More important features first.
- Offer embedded terminals and editors?
- more keyboard shortcuts and GUI hints
- Hot-reloading QML?
- cache for monitor's command results to minimize amount of commands actually run (crude implementation done)
- automatic module testing and documentation.
- new module property `privileged` for modules that require sudo/root
- Check and display vuln status of system (or docker) packages using mitre, DSA and etc.
- Utilize system icons and themes? Can still offer and default to baked in style when necessary.
- easily add self-made scripts (shell scripts etc.) as commands?
- modules as shared objects instead of compiled in? or loadable scripts?
- Support SaaS-platforms? (probably outside of scope)

# Problems
- There doesn't seem to be a default hover-animation for RoundButton. Add a custom one?
